# About the repository
All required features have been implemented and a it has a working website with 
the required features, with a backend framework made with django (I choosed django 
since it is the one I have recent experience with although I could also use 
Javascript for backend-development). Website was deployed using vercel and the database
is being hosted in Mongodb Atlas

# Link for the website with a working backend namely delete and fetch api calls

"NOTE: Please refrain from deleting all data on the website as it is necessary for testing
 and ensuring that there is sufficient data available for testing purposes."
